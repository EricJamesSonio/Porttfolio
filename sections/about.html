  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <div class="about-intro">
    <p>
      I'm a 4th-year <strong>Computer Science student at the College of Mary Immaculate</strong> 
      and a passionate <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> with a strong focus and strength 
      in <strong>backend development</strong>. I love building systems that are stable, scalable, 
      and well-architected from the ground up.
    </p>

    <p>
      While I enjoy working across the full stack, backend engineering is where I truly excel — 
      from designing databases and structuring APIs to optimizing performance and ensuring 
      clean, maintainable architecture.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="about-subtitle">What I Do</h2>
  <p>
    I specialize in crafting reliable backend systems, organizing data models, building REST 
    and GraphQL APIs, and integrating complete full-stack features. I prioritize clarity, 
    performance, and long-term maintainability in every project I work on.
  </p>

  <h2 class="about-subtitle">Mindset & Goals</h2>
  <p>
    I’m <strong>willing to work, eager to grow, and always open to new opportunities</strong> 
    that challenge me to improve as a developer. I love learning — whether it’s mastering 
    new tools, exploring new technologies, or leveling up my engineering skills.
  </p>

  <h2 class="about-subtitle">Beyond Coding</h2>
  <p>
    Outside of development, I’m a <strong>lead guitarist</strong>, a gym enthusiast, and someone 
    who enjoys continuously developing myself both inside and outside tech. I strongly value 
    teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.
  </p>

  <h2 class="about-subtitle">A Little Story</h2>
  <p>
    Fun fact: I accidentally enrolled in BSBA before switching to Computer Science — which made 
    my first few weeks in college unexpectedly hilarious. But that twist eventually led me to 
    discover my passion for building software.
